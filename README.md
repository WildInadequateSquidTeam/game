The game
--------------
It seems like it's not actually a game (since there are no idea or story).

Development
-----------
Current master is just a very rough stub, written as is, with pass-through logic almost everywhere.

Build
-----
###### Server
Just clone the repo, and run [server/main.js](https://github.com/WildInadequateSquidTeam/game/blob/master/server/main.js).

###### Client
Use [old client index.html](https://github.com/WildInadequateSquidTeam/game/blob/master/OLD_client/index.html) 
to run the game.


That should work :D
