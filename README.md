The game
--------------
It seems like it's not actually a game (since there are no idea or story).

Development
-----------
Current master is just a very rough stub, written as is, with pass-through logic almost everywhere.

Build
-----
How to run:
###### Server
* ```git clone git@github.com:WildInadequateSquidTeam/game.git```
* ```cd game/server```
* ```npm install```
* ```node main.js```

###### Client
Use [old client index.html](https://github.com/WildInadequateSquidTeam/game/blob/master/OLD_client/index.html) 
to run the game. Don't forget to change hardcoded IP. (nice :D) 


That should work :D
